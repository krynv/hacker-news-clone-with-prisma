# Hacker News Clone with Prisma

A Prisma powered API that mimics the functionality of Hacker News. 
Essetially a Prisma powered [feature-rich-graphql-express-server](https://github.com/krynv/feature-rich-graphql-express-server), but uses limit-offset pagination instead.

Runs on GraphQL Yoga (which is already built on top of Express).
